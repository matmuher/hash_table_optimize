# Hash table

This project consists of two parts:
	
1. Hash functions comparison
2. Hash table low-level optimize

## Hash functions comparison

We will compare hash functions to use one of them in hash table. So we will examine them for density of filling the hash table.

Functions for exploration:

1.
